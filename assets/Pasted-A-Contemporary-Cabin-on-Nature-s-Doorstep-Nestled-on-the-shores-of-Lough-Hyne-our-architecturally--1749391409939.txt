A Contemporary Cabin on Nature’s Doorstep

Nestled on the shores of Lough Hyne, our architecturally designed wood cabin combines the best of both worlds: nature and luxury. Built with local timber by skilled craftsmen, the cabin is cosy, bright and inspired by Danish Hygge principles. With heated concrete floors, a luxury double shower and plush Brooklin linens, we’ve created a space where you can relax, recharge and truly unwind.



Cosy Comfort with a View

The open-plan design features a folding double bed, perfect for stretching out after a day of exploring. Want more space? The mezzanine offers an ideal spot for reading or stargazing, with stunning views over Lough Hyne. When the weather’s nice, the deck becomes your personal sanctuary—perfect for sipping coffee, reading a book or just soaking in the natural beauty.



A Taste of Local Life

At Lough Hyne Cottage, we take food seriously. Every Sunday, we bake wood-fired sourdough for the local market, using organic ingredients and old-school baking techniques. We also grow fresh veggies for top local restaurants, so if you’re into farm-to-table, you’re in the right place. Feel free to wander around the farm and sample whatever’s in season. On Saturdays, we offer a breakfast basket with fresh bread and pastries for just €20.



The Lough Experience

Step outside, and you’re just 50 metres from the Lough itself, where you can take a refreshing swim in Europe’s only saltwater lake. In the colder months, the outdoor wood-fired bath is perfect for warming up and stargazing. In winter, the cottage becomes a snug retreat, ideal for romantic getaways or quiet weekends spent reading, relaxing and enjoying the quiet.



West Cork 

Lough Hyne is situated in the heart of West Cork, known for its culinary scene and bohemian charm. With festivals, food markets and plenty of artistic energy, there’s always something to explore. But honestly, some of the best days are spent just soaking in the scenery, sipping coffee and enjoying the simple pleasures of life.



Year-Round Bliss


Whether it’s summer swims in the Lough or winter nights by the outdoor bath, Lough Hyne Cottage offers a peaceful escape all year long. We’ve created a space where you can slow down and enjoy nature at its best. We can’t wait to share it with you!
