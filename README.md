# Lough Hyne Cottage - Railway Deployment Package

This package contains a simplified Railway-compatible version of the Lough Hyne Cottage website that addresses all deployment errors encountered in previous attempts.

## Key Features Included

### ✅ Authentic Content
- Exact copy from the Replit application
- Real Lough Hyne Cottage text and descriptions
- Authentic cottage images served from loughhynecottage.com CDN
- Hero video from the original website

### ✅ Railway Optimization
- Pure Node.js/Express with CommonJS modules (no TypeScript compilation issues)
- Minimal dependencies to avoid import conflicts
- Immediate health check response for Railway requirements
- Single-file architecture eliminates complex build chains

### ✅ Error Fixes Applied
- No top-level await expressions
- No ESM import/export syntax causing compilation errors
- No complex TypeScript dependencies
- No database initialization blocking startup
- No React build process dependencies
- Unified CSS instead of Tailwind build chain

### ✅ Content Accuracy
Matches Replit application exactly:
- "The Lough is calling you home" hero message
- "A Contemporary Cabin on Nature's Doorstep" section
- "Unplug. Unwind. Uncover Lough Hyne." tagline
- Authentic cottage descriptions and pricing
- Real cottage photos and video

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Upload to Railway:**
   ```bash
   # Create new Railway project
   railway new
   
   # Deploy these files
   - package.json
   - server.js
   - README.md
   ```

2. **Environment Variables (Optional):**
   ```
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect Node.js application
   - Run `npm install`
   - Start with `npm start` (which runs `node server.js`)
   - Health check passes immediately at `/health`

## Why This Version Works

### Previous Deployment Failures:
- **TypeScript Compilation:** Railway couldn't compile complex TS imports
- **Top-level Await:** Caused module loading errors
- **ESM/CommonJS Conflicts:** Import syntax issues
- **Complex Dependencies:** React build chains failed
- **Database Dependencies:** Blocking startup sequence
- **Health Check Timeout:** Complex apps took too long to respond

### This Solution:
- **Pure JavaScript:** No compilation required
- **CommonJS Modules:** Native Node.js compatibility
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only Express and security middleware
- **Immediate Startup:** Health check responds instantly
- **Self-Contained:** All styling and scripts inline
- **CDN Images:** No local asset dependencies
